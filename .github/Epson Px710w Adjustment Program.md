# How to Reset the Waste Ink Pad Counter on Epson PX710W Printer
 
If you own an Epson PX710W printer, you may encounter a problem where the printer stops working and displays an error message that the ink pads are at the end of their service life. This means that the waste ink pad counter has reached its limit and needs to be reset. The waste ink pad counter is a feature that prevents the printer from overflowing with excess ink during cleaning cycles. However, resetting the counter is not a difficult task and can be done with a special software tool called Epson PX710W Adjustment Program.

The Epson PX710W Adjustment Program is a utility program that allows you to perform various functions on your printer, such as resetting the waste ink pad counter, adjusting the print head, initializing the printer, and more. You can download the program from [this website](https://orpys.com/en/epson/70-px710w-adjustment-program.html) for a small fee. The program works only with USB connection and Windows operating system. Before you use the program, make sure you have installed the printer driver and connected the printer to your computer.
 
To reset the waste ink pad counter on your Epson PX710W printer, follow these steps:
 
1. Run the Epson PX710W Adjustment Program on your computer.
2. Select your printer model and port from the drop-down menus.
3. Click "Particular adjustment mode".
4. Select "Waste ink pad counter" from the list and click "OK".
5. Check the boxes next to "Main pad counter" and "Platen pad counter".
6. Click "Check" to see the current values of the counters.
7. Click "Initialization" to reset the counters to zero.
8. Click "Finish" when the process is completed.
9. Turn off your printer and wait for a few seconds.
10. Turn on your printer again and check if the error message is gone.

Congratulations! You have successfully reset the waste ink pad counter on your Epson PX710W printer. You can now resume printing as usual. However, keep in mind that resetting the counter does not solve the problem of ink accumulation in the pads. You may need to replace or clean the pads periodically to avoid ink leakage or damage to your printer. You can also use the Epson PX710W Adjustment Program to perform other maintenance tasks on your printer, such as cleaning the print head, aligning the print head, checking the nozzle pattern, etc. For more details, refer to [the service manual](https://manualmachine.com/epson/px710/8622068-service-manual/) of your printer or watch [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGOf4H2vkwo).
  
The Epson PX710W is not only a printer, but also a scanner and a copier. The scanner has a high resolution of 2400 x 4800dpi and can scan both photos and documents with ease. You can use the scanner as a standalone device or with the bundled software, such as Epson Scan and Abbyy Finereader. The copier function allows you to make up to 99 copies of an original, with options to resize, crop, adjust brightness and contrast, and enhance photos. You can also copy directly from memory cards or USB drives without using a computer.
 
One of the main attractions of the Epson PX710W is its photo printing capability. The printer uses six Claria dye-based inks that promise vibrant colours, smooth gradations, and long-lasting prints. The printer can handle various sizes and types of photo paper, including A4, 10 x 15cm, 13 x 18cm, and CD/DVD labels. You can print photos directly from memory cards or USB drives using the LCD screen and the control panel buttons, or from your computer using the Epson Easy Photo Print software. You can also print wirelessly from your smartphone or tablet using the Epson iPrint app.

The Epson PX710W has received mixed reviews from users and experts. Some of the positive aspects of the printer are its sleek design, its good connectivity options, its improved speed compared to previous models, its great scanning quality, and its fairly crisp text output. However, some of the negative aspects are its photo quality that should be better for a dedicated photo printer, its print heads that are prone to blockages and require frequent cleaning cycles, its second paper tray that can only hold postcard-size paper, its slower performance than its rivals from Canon and HP, and its LCD screen that is a little small for previewing photos. Overall, the Epson PX710W is a versatile and well-connected all-in-one printer that can handle various tasks, but it may not satisfy the most demanding photo enthusiasts.
