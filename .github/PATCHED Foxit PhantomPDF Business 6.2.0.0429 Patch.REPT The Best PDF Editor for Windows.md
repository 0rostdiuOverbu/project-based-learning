## Creating a Ribbon Interface with the Office 2010 Ribbon Control
 
The Office 2010 Ribbon control is a new control that allows you to create a ribbon interface for your application, similar to the one used by Microsoft Office 2010. The ribbon interface consists of a ribbon bar that contains tabs, groups, and buttons, and a quick access toolbar that contains frequently used commands. You can also use the ribbon's contextual tabs and backstage view features to provide context-sensitive options and commands to your users.
 
To use the Office 2010 Ribbon control in your application, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Add a reference to the Infragistics4.Win.v10.3.dll assembly to your project.
2. Add a using directive for the Infragistics.Win.UltraWinToolbars namespace to your code file.
3. Drag and drop an UltraToolbarsManager component from the toolbox to your form.
4. Select the UltraToolbarsManager component and set its Style property to Office2010.
5. Click on the UltraToolbarsManager component and select Launch Designer from the smart tag menu.
6. In the UltraToolbarsManager Designer window, click on the Ribbon tab and check the Enable Ribbon option.
7. Click on the Add Tab button to add a new tab to the ribbon bar. You can rename the tab by double-clicking on it.
8. Click on the Add Group button to add a new group to the tab. You can rename the group by double-clicking on it.
9. Click on the Add Button button to add a new button to the group. You can set the properties of the button, such as text, image, tooltip, etc., in the Properties window.
10. Repeat steps 7-9 to add more tabs, groups, and buttons to the ribbon bar as needed.
11. To add a quick access toolbar to your application, click on the Quick Access Toolbar tab in the UltraToolbarsManager Designer window and check the Enable Quick Access Toolbar option.
12. Click on the Add Button button to add a new button to the quick access toolbar. You can set the properties of the button in the Properties window.
13. Repeat step 12 to add more buttons to the quick access toolbar as needed.
14. To add contextual tabs to your application, click on the Contextual Tabs tab in the UltraToolbarsManager Designer window and click on the Add Contextual Tab Group button.
15. Select the contextual tab group and set its properties, such as text, color, key, etc., in the Properties window.
16. Click on the Add Tab button to add a new tab to the contextual tab group. You can rename the tab by double-clicking on it.
17. Click on the Add Group button to add a new group to the tab. You can rename the group by double-clicking on it.
18. Click on the Add Button button to add a new button to the group. You can set the properties of the button in the Properties window.

20. To activate or deactivate a contextual tab group in your code, you need to use
the ActivateContextualTabGroup or DeactivateContextualTabGroup methods of
the UltraToolbarsManager component. For example:
```csharp
// Activate a contextual tab group with key "PictureTools"

```
